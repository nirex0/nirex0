### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Aryan, I and love computers.

- âš¡ Fun fact: A strawberry is not an actual berry, but a banana is. By technical definition, a berry is a fleshy fruit produced from a single seed. The strawberry, however has its dry, yellow "seeds" on the outside (each of which is actually considered a separate fruit).
